    ==>     JavaScript Comparison operators are mainly used to perform the logical operations that determine the equality or difference between the values. Comparison operators are used in logical expressions to determine their equality or differences in variables or values. 

   ==>     JavaScript Comparison Operators list: There are so many comparison operators as shown in the table with the description.

OPERATOR NAME                       USAGE   OPERATON

1.Equality Operator	                a==b	Compares the equality of two operators
2.Inequality Operator	            a!=b	Compares inequality of two operators
3.Strict Equality Operator          a===b	Compares both value and type of the operand
4.Strict Inequality Operator	    a!==b	Compares inequality with type
5.Greater than Operator	            a>b	    Checks if the left operator is greater than the right operator
6.Greater than or equal Operator 	a>=b	Checks if the left operator is greater than or equal to the right operator
7.Less than Operator	            a<b	    Checks if the left operator is smaller than the right operator
